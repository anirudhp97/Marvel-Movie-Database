# Marvel-Movie-Database
What is this project all about?<br>
Getting the overall feel of the movie before it is watched is important to manage your expectations about the said movie. But scrolling through scores of reviews can be tedious. So here comes my project, "Marvel Movie Database", where the reviews are highlighted pictorically. With this you can get an overall gist of the audience pulse via few important keywords used in their reviews. The project for now are focused mainly on the lates phase of marvel movies. <br> <br>

So how does this project work?<br>
The reviews and movie ratings are fetched from the imdb website. When a user selects a movie the reviews are fetched and processed in real-time and latest wordcloud is displayed to the user higlighting the keywords used by the audience. <br> <br>

What is the tech stack used for this project? <br>
For the front-end part simple HTML and CSS is used. Flask is used as the backend for this project. This is where all the fetching of the reviews, cleansing of the text and generation of wordcloud is performed. IMDB library is used to fetch the reviews and the ratings for each movie.<br> <br>
